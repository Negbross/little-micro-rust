This is for my another project, I build this for my flutter project.\
It was inspired from Google search engine that called microservice,\
It was based from that, I think.

I was using JetBrain RustRover, so I use HttpClient plugin \, 
and that was an example image called <ins>gambar.png</ins>

Step:
```
cargo install \
sea-orm-cli migrate \
sea-orm-cli generate entity -o entity/src -l \
cargo run
```
